A full-featured social network developed as part of the **"Samurai Way"** course by IT-Kamasutra. This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) implementing core features of modern social platforms.

**âœ¨ Current Status:** Actively enhancing the project through the second part of the course, adding new features, optimizations, and personal improvements.

## ðŸš€ Features

*   **Authentication System:** Login and logout with form validation
*   **User Profiles:** View and edit profile information (status, photo, contacts)
*   **News Feed:** Browse posts from other users and publish your own
*   **User Search:** Find and follow/unfollow other users
*   **Messaging System:** Real-time messaging between users
*   **Pagination:** Efficient data loading and display
*   **Form Handling:** Comprehensive form validation and submission

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/samurai-social-network.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd samurai-social-network
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals & Learning Outcomes

This educational project was created to deeply explore the modern React and TypeScript development stack. Through this work, I mastered:

### **React Fundamentals**
*   Component-based architecture thinking
*   Virtual DOM and reconciliation process
*   Props drilling and component communication
*   Conditional rendering and list rendering patterns

### **Advanced Concepts**
*   State management patterns and best practices
*   Side effects management with useEffect
*   Performance optimization techniques
*   Code splitting and lazy loading

### **TypeScript Integration**
*   Type safety in React components
*   Interface design for props and state
*   Generic types in hooks and functions
*   Type definitions for third-party libraries

### **Real-World Development**
*   API integration and data fetching strategies
*   Error handling and loading states
*   Form management and validation
*   Authentication flow implementation

## ðŸ”„ Ongoing Enhancements

Following the second part of the course, I'm continuously improving the project with:
- **Advanced React patterns** and best practices
- **Performance optimizations** and code splitting
- **Additional features** beyond the course curriculum
- **Code refactoring** and architecture improvements
