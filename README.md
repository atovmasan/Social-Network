A full-featured social network developed as part of the "Samurai Way" course by IT-Kamasutra. This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) implementing core features of modern social platforms.

Important Note: While the project was built following the course, it includes custom improvements and enhancements for better understanding of technologies and skills demonstration.

ðŸš§ Current Development Status: I'm currently working through the second part of the course and actively improving the project. New features, optimizations, and personal enhancements are being implemented regularly.

ðŸš€ Features
Authentication System: Login and logout with form validation

User Profiles: View and edit profile information (status, photo, contacts)

News Feed: Browse posts from other users and publish your own

User Search: Find and follow/unfollow other users

Messaging System: Real-time messaging between users

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript

State Management: Redux, Redux Thunk

Routing: React Router DOM

HTTP Client: Axios

Styling: CSS Modules, Pure CSS

Backend: Uses REST API provided in the course

ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/samurai-social-network.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd samurai-social-network
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
ðŸŽ¯ Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
This educational project was created to deeply explore the modern React and TypeScript development stack. Through this work, I mastered:

Fundamental React concepts (components, hooks, lifecycle)

TypeScript usage for typing components, props, and state

Managing complex application state with Redux (Thunk for side effects)

REST API interaction (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests)

Form handling and validation

Project structure and code organization

ðŸ”„ Ongoing Improvements
Following the second part of the course, I'm continuously enhancing the project with:

Advanced React patterns and best practices

Performance optimizations

Code refactoring and architecture improvements

Additional features beyond the course curriculum

Personal experiments and custom implementations
